## Notes
  * Jalapeño intensity varies
  * Spice/Heat is a personal preference and jalapeño quantity should be adjusted accordingly
    * If you tend to be spice averse, 1/2 the quantity to begin
  * Salt: I never needed to add salt — the pork & bacon are enough salting for me
  * I typically double the recipe and use two (2) slow cookers
  *  **Measure with your heart!** ... as long as you remember it all should fit in your slow cooker...
